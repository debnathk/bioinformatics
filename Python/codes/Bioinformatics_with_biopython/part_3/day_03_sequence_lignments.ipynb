    "## Context:\n",
    "- Pairwise Sequence Alignment is used to identify regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural and/or evolutionary relationships between two biological sequences (protein or nucleic acid)\n",
    "- Identifying the similar region enables us to infer a lot of information like what traits are conserved between species, how close different species genetically are, how species evolve, etc\n",
    "- Pairwise sequence alignment uses a dynamic programming to the optimal alignment between the two sequences, scoring based on their similarity (how similar they are) or distance (how different they are), and then assessing the significance of this score\n",
    "- Two types - global (comparing overall sequence) and local (comparing subsequence)\n",
    "- Two parameters - match score (indiacates compatibility of two characters) and gap penalty (penalty assigned for mismatch)\n",
    "- Two built-in pairwise aligners: **Bio.pairwise2 module** and **PairwiseAligner class within Bio.Align module**"
