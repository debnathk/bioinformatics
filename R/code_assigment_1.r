## Question 1: ####
#   Write an R code to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 and store the
#   result in a variable called `sum_result`.
# Solution

# Question 2: ####
#   Write a function in R called `multiply_by_two` that takes a numeric vector as
#   input and returns a new vector with each element multiplied by 2. For example,
#     if the input vector is `c(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function should return `c(2, 4, 6, 8)`.

# Question 3: ####
#   Create a data frame in R called `student_scores` with the following data:
#   ```
# Name   Score
# John   85
# Emily  92
# Daniel 78
# Sophia 88
# ```
# Write R code to add a new column called `Grade` to the `student_scores` data frame,
# which assigns grades 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D' based on the following criteria:
#   - Score >= 90: 'A'
# - Score >= 80: 'B'
# - Score >= 70: 'C'
# - Otherwise: 'D'

# Question 4: ####
#   Write an R code to generate a histogram of 100 random numbers following a normal
#   distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Set the title of the
#   plot as "Random Numbers Histogram".

# Question 5: ####
#   Create a function in R called `calculate_fibonacci` that takes an integer `n`
#   as input and returns a vector of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci
#   sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two
#   preceding numbers. For example, if `n = 6`, the function should return `c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)`.
